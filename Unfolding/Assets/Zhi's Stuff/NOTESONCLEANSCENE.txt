You'll receive an error on play, one from android (assuming you are using the simulator)

The rotateble bridge requires a sprite renderer which is deleted so you'll get errors from that.

Main Menu is in here but you will start off right off the bat playing the game.


Note* 	If you see animator inactive, ignore the message due to saving resources.
	If you want to start on the other pages, ummmmm good luck? Cause of how Unity animator deals with animations, 	you can't play in mid game.
